            <p>Bethesda Game Studios and Virtuos' The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered is out now and features a wide range of improvements and tweaks that give the 19-year-old RPG classic a fresh coat of paint.</p>

            <p>The team behind the overhaul revealed all during a special broadcast today, hitting the highlights of the biggest changes. It's a livestream that acted as a showcase for drastically altered visuals as well as a handful of gameplay changes that will have Cyrodiil looking and feeling more foreign than ever, and fans have already taken notice. Although some players are hesitant about some of the many, many changes, most players seem to be happy to have another excuse to dive back into one of Bethesda's defining games.</p>
            
            <h2>Oblivion in Unreal Engine 5</h2>
            
            <p>Oblivion is approaching its 20th birthday and is known for some somewhat potato-y character models and stiff animations. It's part of the charm that has kept the RPG classic in players' minds for decades, but it's also something that Bethesda and Virtuos wanted to touch up in the Oblivion remaster.</p>
            
            <p>The remaster brings completely rebuilt character models, modern lighting effects, and significantly improved textures that make the world of Cyrodiil feel more alive than ever. The team has also implemented a new physics system and completely redone the animation system, making combat and movement feel much more fluid.</p>
            
            <p>Fans have been particularly impressed with the environmental upgrades. The forests now have proper density, water effects have been completely overhauled, and distant terrain rendering has been improved to eliminate the "pop-in" effect that was common in the original game.</p>
            
            <p>One of the most controversial changes has been the complete overhaul of the dialogue system. The original's famously awkward "zoom-in" on NPC faces has been replaced with a more cinematic approach, and all dialogue has been re-recorded with the original voice actors where possible.</p>
            
            <p>Despite these sweeping changes, the developers have emphasized that they've tried to maintain the original game's quirky charm. All of the original bugs that became beloved features (like the infamous "arrow to the knee" dialogue) have been preserved in a special "Classic Mode" that players can toggle.</p>
            
            <p>The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The game includes all original DLC as well as some new content developed specifically for this release.</p>
