            <p class="highlight">"A fun intergalactic heist adventure with great exploration, but it's hindered by simple stealth, repetitive combat, and a few too many bugs at launch."</p>
            
            <p>Ubisoft had already confirmed Star Wars: Outlaws as one of the games that will be coming to the Nintendo Switch 2, but today we learned the space adventure won't be a launch title when the new Nintendo handheld is released on June 5, instead arriving a few months later on September 4.</p>

            <p class="image-caption">Star Wars Outlaws - Official Nintendo Switch 2 Announcement Trailer</p>
            
            <p>If you missed it on PS5, XBox and PC, Star Wars Outlaws is set between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi and follows Kay Vess, a small time criminal who finds herself with a death mark from a cartel against her name. Our reviewer gave it a 7, saying it was "a fun intergalactic heist adventure with great exploration, but it's hindered by simple stealth, repetitive combat, and a few too many bugs at launch."</p>
            
            <h2>Switch 2 Version Details</h2>
            
            <p>Ubisoft didn't have many details to share beyond reiterating that the title would be available on Nintendo Switch 2 and confirming when, but at least we can update the Switch 2 Games List. With American and Canadian gamers locked in pre-order limbo as Nintendo assesses the impact of the new tariffs introduced by the Republican administration, any news on Nintendo Switch 2 games getting released is a welcome distraction.</p>
            
            <p>The developers have promised that the Switch 2 version will include all the content from the original release, including the first story expansion. They're also working on optimizing the game for Nintendo's new hardware, though specific details about graphical differences or performance targets haven't been revealed yet.</p>
            
            <h2>A Pirate's Fortune Coming Soon</h2>
            
            <p>The news was announced during a panel at Star Wars Celebration in Japan today, where Ubisoft also gave fans a look at the second story pack headed to Star Wars: Outlaws, titled A Pirate's Fortune. The add on will see Kay joining allying with Hondo Ohnaka to take on Stinger Tash, leader of the Rokana Raiders. Star Wars: Outlaws: A Pirate's Fortune will be released on May 15.</p>
            
            <p>This expansion promises to introduce new smuggling missions, pirate hideouts to discover, and additional customization options for Kay's ship. Fans of the Clone Wars animated series will be particularly excited to see fan-favorite character Hondo Ohnaka brought to life in the game.</p>
